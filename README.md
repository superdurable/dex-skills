# Dex Skills

Dex Skills is the official agent-skill monorepo for building with
[Superdurable Dex](https://docs.superdurable.io). One `superdurable-dex` plugin
ships three skills for Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor:

The plugin is displayed as **Dex**. `Super Durable` remains the marketplace
publisher, while the stable plugin ID remains `superdurable-dex`.

| Skill | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `dex-app-builder` | Discover, prototype, implement, and locally verify an end-to-end Dex AI Platform product with a Go backend. |
| `dex-sdk` | Implement, debug, test, and operate Dex applications in Python, Go, Java, TypeScript, or Rust. |
| `dex-connector-contributor` | Create, verify, and upstream official connector operations, Triggers, and configuration UI units. |

Start with `dex-app-builder` for Dex product, application, and process work. It
loads the specialist `dex-sdk` and `dex-connector-contributor` skills when the
confirmed design requires them. Invoke a specialist directly only for a
standalone SDK or official connector-library task. Install the complete plugin
so all three skills are present.

## Requires a coding workspace

Dex Skills is a developer plugin, not a hosted application builder. To create
or modify an application, use it in Codex or another coding-agent host that has
a writable repository or project workspace plus file-editing and command tools.
The workspace can be an existing repository or a new empty repository.

Without that workspace, the skills can still help with business discovery,
architecture, and an implementation handoff. They cannot create project files,
run tests, build artifacts, or deploy the application from an ordinary chat.

## Install

Choose exactly one installation path:

1. **Plugin (recommended):** installs all three Skills together and uses the
   host's marketplace lifecycle.
2. **Standalone Skills:** installs all three Skills directly with the Agent
   Skills CLI.

Do not install both. Duplicate copies can shadow one another and make the
loaded version ambiguous.

The invocation syntax depends on both the host and the installation path.

### Codex desktop app

Open the plugin browser, choose **Add a marketplace**, and use:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `https://github.com/superdurable/dex-skills` |
| Git ref | `main` |
| Sparse paths | Leave empty. |

Add the marketplace, open **Super Durable**, and install **Dex**. This route
does not require the separate Codex CLI.

To use the Plugin, type `@`, select **Dex** from the picker, then enter a
natural-language request. Typing the plain text `@Dex` without selecting the
picker item does not create the Plugin binding.

### Codex CLI

Only use this route when `codex --version` works in the shell:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add superdurable/dex-skills
codex plugin add superdurable-dex@superdurable
```

Open an existing repository or create an empty one, then start a new task.
Type `@`, select **Dex**, and enter the request. For example:

```text
Add <XYZ> to Dex official connector library
```

Raw `@Dex` text in the initial `codex` prompt or `codex exec` does not create
the structured Plugin binding. Codex may route an installed Plugin from a
matching natural-language request, but scripts that require deterministic
explicit invocation should use the standalone Skills path below.

### Claude web and desktop

Open **Customize → Plugins → Add → Add marketplace**, choose **Add from a
repository**, and enter `https://github.com/superdurable/dex-skills`. Install
**Dex** from the **Super Durable** marketplace. Claude saves the installation
to the account, so it is also available in Claude Code when signed in with the
same account on Claude Code 2.1.273 or later. On older Claude Code versions,
use the manual CLI installation below.

Claude web and desktop use natural-language routing or the `/` picker. This
repository does not distribute standalone ZIP Skills for those surfaces.

### Claude Code CLI

Run from a shell where the `claude` command is installed:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add superdurable/dex-skills
claude plugin install superdurable-dex@superdurable
```

Or run the slash-command equivalents inside an interactive Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace add superdurable/dex-skills
/plugin install superdurable-dex@superdurable
```

Invoke `/superdurable-dex:dex-sdk`, `/superdurable-dex:dex-app-builder`, or
`/superdurable-dex:dex-connector-contributor`. For example:

```text
/superdurable-dex:dex-connector-contributor Add <XYZ> to Dex official connector library
```

### Cursor desktop app

Open a project, then use **Customize → Plugins → Add → From GitHub Repository**
and enter `github.com/superdurable/dex-skills`. Open **Dex**, select
**Install**, and choose a user or project scope. The three Skills appear as
`/dex-sdk`, `/dex-app-builder`, and `/dex-connector-contributor`.

### Cursor CLI

Cursor's official documentation describes marketplace installation through
**Customize** and does not provide a non-interactive shell command for
installing this GitHub marketplace. A user-scope desktop installation is
available in Cursor CLI. Alternatively, start `cursor-agent`, enter `/plugin`,
open the Marketplace tab, and install **Dex**. Do not guess a
`cursor plugin install` command.

### Standalone Skills

Use this path instead of the Plugin. Install all three Skills together for the
selected coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add superdurable/dex-skills --skill '*' --agent codex --global
npx skills add superdurable/dex-skills --skill '*' --agent claude-code --global
npx skills add superdurable/dex-skills --skill '*' --agent cursor --global
```

Invoke the standalone connector contributor with the host's Skill syntax:

| Host | Invocation |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `$dex-connector-contributor Add <XYZ> to Dex official connector library` |
| Claude Code | `/dex-connector-contributor Add <XYZ> to Dex official connector library` |
| Cursor | `/dex-connector-contributor Add <XYZ> to Dex official connector library` |

Cursor uses the same short slash command for Plugin and standalone installs;
the installation source differs even though the invocation text does not.

The standalone bundle is for coding-agent hosts. Use the Plugin path for
Claude web and desktop.

## Upgrade

An active chat keeps the Plugin or Skills version it loaded when the chat
started. After an upgrade, restart the client when applicable and begin a new
chat in the repository.

### Standalone Skills

Update all three Skills together:

```bash
npx skills update dex-app-builder dex-sdk dex-connector-contributor --global
```

If the installed `skills` CLI does not support `update`, rerun the exact
host-specific `npx skills add ... --skill '*' --agent ... --global` command
from the installation section.

### Automatic future-version reminder

Versions `0.25.4` and earlier do not contain the lifecycle hook, so they cannot
reliably discover `0.25.5`. Upgrade to `0.25.5` manually once. Starting with
`0.25.5`, each new session checks GitHub's latest formal release and can remind
you about a future `0.25.6` or later release.

Codex and Claude Code run the check at session start. Cursor warms the cache
when a workspace opens and reads it when a session starts. A result is cached
for 15 minutes. When the cache has expired, the GitHub request waits at most
about one second and uses ETag revalidation. Until you upgrade, every new Dex
chat can include the reminder; unrelated chats remain silent. Restoring an old
chat or compacting its context does not repeat it.

The Plugin hook reads the installed `VERSION` and requests only public release
metadata from GitHub. It does not read or upload the prompt, repository files,
credentials, or project content. It only suggests an upgrade; it never changes
or upgrades the Plugin automatically. Standalone Skills use the same
best-effort version comparison from their packaged reference, but they have no
Plugin lifecycle hook and are never updated automatically by Dex.

Codex asks you to review and trust the hook when a hook-enabled release is first
enabled. Because `0.25.6` adds clearer review metadata, upgrading from `0.25.5`
requires one more review; later hook-definition changes may do the same. The
review description states that the hook reads public GitHub release metadata
only and never installs updates. Claude Code and Cursor use their own plugin
hooks; disable the hook in the client's hook settings, or disable the plugin,
to turn it off. If hooks are disabled, untrusted, blocked by enterprise policy,
missing a Node runtime, or unsupported in the current cloud environment, the
loaded Dex skill falls back to one best-effort release check. All hook and
fallback failures are silent and never block the requested work.

### Codex desktop app

Open the plugin browser's marketplace management view, find **Super Durable**,
and select **Upgrade**. Wait for the upgrade to finish, restart the desktop app,
and start a new task. No Codex CLI command is required for this route.

### Codex CLI

Refresh only the Super Durable marketplace, then start a new Codex session:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade superdurable
codex
```

Inside Codex CLI, open `/plugins` and confirm that **Dex** is enabled.

### Claude Code CLI

Update Dex directly from a shell:

```bash
claude plugin update superdurable-dex@superdurable
```

Or update the marketplace inside an interactive Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace update superdurable
```

Start a new session after a manual update. To receive future releases
automatically, open `/plugin`, select **Marketplaces → Super Durable**, and
select **Enable auto-update**.

### Claude web and desktop

Claude's public web and desktop documentation does not describe a separate
per-user upgrade command. Organization-managed GitHub marketplaces are updated
by an owner from **Organization settings → Plugins & skills → Marketplaces →
Update**; account users receive the synced version. The Claude Code commands
above are the documented manual route for a personally registered marketplace.

### Cursor

For a GitHub-imported team marketplace, an administrator can click **Refresh**
or enable **Auto Refresh**, then users reload the Cursor window. Cursor does not
document a personal `cursor plugin update` shell command for a direct GitHub
import; manage that installation through **Customize** instead of guessing one.

## Migrating from the old plugin

The former Plugin ID `dex` and Skill name `dex-developer` were replaced by
`superdurable-dex` and `dex-sdk`. Remove or update the old marketplace install,
choose either the current Plugin or standalone bundle, and start a new task so
the new Skill names are discovered.

A direct skill install is not replaced by the plugin. If
`~/.claude/skills/dex-developer`, another client's skills-directory copy, or an
`npx skills` install of `dex-developer` exists, it keeps loading its older
pinned Server and CLI guidance and can shadow the current installation. Remove
it with the tool that installed it, install exactly one current distribution,
and start a new task.

## Dex SDK

`dex-sdk` uses progressive disclosure. Shared semantics live under
`dex-sdk/references/core/`, and each supported language has a matching handbook.
The skill inspects the project's installed SDK and version-matched runnable
sources before choosing exact APIs.

Exact source excerpts are pinned to the Dex release in `DEX_BASELINE`. CI checks
that every marked snippet remains a contiguous excerpt of its declared source.
The project dependency and lockfile remain authoritative when versions differ.

## Dex App Builder

`dex-app-builder` starts with business discovery: process maintainers, managers,
terminal users, permissions, triggers, actions, waits, approvals, recovery, and
audit requirements. It then confirms **No custom UI** or **Custom UI**.

When the target repository is empty or contains only placeholders such as a
README, App Builder first initializes it from the pinned
`superdurable/dex-template-basic-process` release. It preserves the repository's
Git history and intentional files, then uses the template's `make bootstrap`
path. That release's Go module, npm lockfile, Server/CLI baselines, generators,
directory layout, and Make targets are the default technology stack. App Builder
does not independently select a newer Dex Go SDK, invent a TypeScript backend,
create an ad hoc npm scaffold, or borrow SDK setup from a neighboring project.

No custom UI uses Dex Web v2 for every management interaction. The application
keeps only a non-business Hello World page, one `GetApplicationInfo` OpenAPI
operation, and the Go/OpenAPI/React generation skeleton for future evolution.
It removes approval, display, status, list, detail, Action-proxy, mock-lifecycle,
and other process-management surfaces. A confirmed trigger webhook may remain
as integration ingress.

For a custom frontend, first build only low-fidelity static React pages with
placeholder regions, inputs, buttons, and ordinary navigation links. Run the
Vite frontend without a mock API, give the user direct links to every page, and
confirm only the page inventory, fields, actions, and navigation. Do not add
state, API calls, images, animation, branding, or visual polish at this stage.

After that confirmation, design the Flow, Connector boundaries, and application
OpenAPI contract together. Generate the Go server interfaces and TypeScript
client before implementing the Go backend. Wire the static pages through the
generated client only after the real Dex and Connector paths run, then complete
real E2E. The template mock server remains a contract-level test double after
the schema is fixed. Add imagery and visual polish only after real E2E passes,
then rerun mock E2E, real E2E, and the production build.

Backend implementation is Go-only, starts from
`superdurable/dex-template-basic-process`, and must satisfy strict Dex Web v2 /
FDG 2.0 rendering. The default stack is the exact release recorded in
`TEMPLATE_BASELINE`, with the Dex Go SDK, Dex Server, Dex CLI, Go/Node
dependencies, and commands pinned by that release. The independent
`DEX_BASELINE`, `DEX_SERVER_BASELINE`, and `DEX_CLI_BASELINE` files validate the
skill's reference guidance; they do not authorize upgrading a generated
application. Dex Web v2 is embedded in the template-pinned Server and CLI
artifacts. The current Connector SDK supports application integration only from
the Go backend; TypeScript remains optional frontend code. Connector
integrations reuse released
dedicated connectors from `superdurable/dex-connectors-library`. Generic HTTP
is reserved for controlled internal systems; a missing or defective
external-provider connector routes to `dex-connector-contributor` and blocks
production handoff until released.

Connector selection starts from the canonical published
[`catalog.yaml`](https://superdurable.github.io/dex-connectors-library/catalog.yaml),
then verifies every exact Trigger, Query, Mutation, or UI capability against the
selected component tag's immutable `connector.yaml`. If the catalog or release
manifest cannot be verified, App Builder stops connector-dependent
implementation instead of guessing from memory or falling back to a provider
SDK.

Flow design prefers existing released connector capabilities throughout:
Query/Mutation factories become Connector Steps, Triggers start typed Flows or
invoke typed RPCs, and RPC-requested provider work moves to a Connector Step.
When a public product has a documented API or official SDK but lacks the needed
connector, operation, or Trigger, App Builder routes the gap to
`dex-connector-contributor`. The application can test the local connector
immediately through an uncommitted Go `replace` while its fork and upstream PR
are reviewed, then must pin the exact release. For controlled internal services,
App Builder asks whether an internal connector library already exists or should
be created with the unified Connector SDK before falling back to generic HTTP.

For Go applications, Dex Web reads statically named Connector Steps and Trigger
bindings from FDG 2.0. It configures released Gmail, Slack, GitHub, or other
supported connectors in the local **Connections** view. The default plaintext
development store is `~/.dex/connectors/connections.json`; pass
`--connector-config-dir` to isolate a stack. Start the application with
**DEX_CONNECTOR_CONFIG_FILE** set to the absolute path shown by Dex Web.
The mock validates HTTP and UI behavior only; it cannot prove Dex durability,
Worker replacement, Timer, or RPC semantics. The workflow finishes with local
tests and a clean handoff ready for future Dex AI Platform upload; it does not
claim that upload is available today.

## Dex Connector Contributor

`dex-connector-contributor` is limited to official work in
`superdurable/dex-connectors-library`. It starts from a provider's documented
public API or official SDK, updates `connector.yaml` and generated contracts,
implements provider behavior, adds Trigger and configuration UI units when
needed, and includes a runnable connector-local example. It first discovers and
verifies the user's GitHub fork; when none exists, it asks permission, opens the
official fork page, and waits for the user to click **Create fork** before
cloning that fork locally. A maintainer with verified push access may
explicitly choose an upstream topic branch that follows the repository's branch
convention instead.

The workflow loads `dex-sdk` Core and Go semantics plus the shared Dex Web v2
reference. It validates module-isolated race tests and vet, UI tests/build,
codegen and catalog drift, real Dex integration, strict FDG 2.0, current Dex
compatibility, and repository checks. Trigger examples exercise typed Flow/RPC
routing and replay. Operation-only examples run through Dex Web v2 **Start
Flow**. It finishes with a clean, ready-for-review PR and monitored CI.

Connector source excerpts are pinned to the repository snapshot in
`CONNECTOR_LIBRARY_BASELINE`. The reference releases are Connector SDK
`sdkgo/v0.8.0`, Slack `connectors/slack/v0.9.0`, Gmail
`connectors/google/gmail/v0.10.0`, and Google Sheets
`connectors/google/spreadsheet/v0.7.0`. The snapshot deliberately trails newer
connector releases; new work pins the latest published component tag.

## Releases

The three skills and all client manifests share the version in `VERSION`. A merge
to `main` creates GitHub Release `v<version>` when that tag does not already
exist. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for validation and release rules.
