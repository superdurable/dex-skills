# Troubleshooting

Begin with evidence and keep diagnosis read-only. Capture the Flow ID, run ID, Flow type, SDK version, Dex Server address, Worker build, and the last user-visible operation.

## Diagnostic order

1. Check application and Worker logs for registration, handler, connectivity, codec, and blob errors.
2. Inspect the Flow in Dex Web.
3. Run `dexcli flow inspect <flow-id> --all-history` for a bounded history view.
4. Compare the active Step, Conditions, Attributes, pending Channels, Timers, and recent semantic events with the intended graph.
5. Reproduce the path with the smallest real Dex Server integration test.
6. Fix code or configuration before deciding whether an open execution needs an authorized recovery operation.

Use `dexcli flow search`, `summary`, `state`, and `history` for narrower JSON. Use `--no-hydrate` when payload contents are unnecessary or sensitive.

## Failure routing

- **Worker unavailable**: verify process health, bind address, advertised target, name resolution, and the network path from Dex Server.
- **Unknown Flow, Step, RPC, or resource**: compare the Worker registry and persistence schema with the execution's stable names and deployed version.
- **Flow does not advance**: inspect the active Step's WaitFor conditions and pending Channel, Timer, or SubFlow state.
- **Repeated side effect**: inspect attempts and heartbeat checkpoints; make Execute idempotent or add compensation.
- **Failure after Worker replacement**: look for in-memory correctness state, incompatible codecs, unregistered old Step types, or changed schemas.
- **Large payload or hydration failure**: verify Client and Worker blob configuration, cache permissions, and matching codecs.
- **Lost progress**: determine whether the UI treated a best-effort Stream as durable state.
- **Stale queue mutation**: reload pending Channel messages; a consumed or deleted message ID cannot be reused.
- **Closed Flow interaction**: handle the language SDK's typed terminal/not-active result at the application boundary.

## Recovery boundary

Do not stop, time travel, publish, invoke, edit, delete, or skip a Timer during diagnosis. If the user authorizes recovery, read [operations.md](operations.md), resolve the current run, explain the expected change, perform one public operation, and re-inspect.

Read the selected language's **error-handling.md**, **observability.md**, and **gotchas.md** for concrete SDK behavior.
