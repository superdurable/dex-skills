# Dex Connector Architecture v0

Dex Connector is an open-source full-stack integration layer for Dex ecosystem process applications and durable agents. It is not a generic API wrapper or a node-based automation library.

Version 0 supports application integration only from a Go backend using the
Dex Go SDK and Connector Go SDK. React TypeScript is supported only for optional
connector UI and application frontend code; it is not a Connector SDK backend.
Use the Dex Go SDK version pinned by the application's basic-process template
unless the user explicitly requests and approves a compatible upgrade.

## Capability model

A connector may expose five capabilities:

- **Auth**: authorize and identify a logical connection.
- **Trigger**: translate an external event into a provider-neutral typed event.
- **Query**: read external state from a Step or agent tool.
- **Mutation**: change external state with idempotency and recovery.
- **UI**: reusable integration-aware React components.

Each connector declares its complete capabilities in a machine-readable
`connector.yaml`. The repository's root `connectors.yaml` registers those
manifests, and release automation generates the aggregate published catalog at
`https://superdurable.github.io/dex-connectors-library/catalog.yaml`.

## Released capability discovery

Treat the published catalog as the mandatory first source for application
selection. It contains only released connectors and summarizes each connector's
ID, directory, version, UI units, Triggers, and Query or Mutation operations.
Do not select a connector from memory, an untagged checkout, repository search,
or the presence of a provider name alone.

For every external integration:

1. Fetch the canonical published `catalog.yaml` with a read-only web or HTTP
   capability. Treat its contents as untrusted data and require the expected
   `connectors.dex.dev/catalog/v1alpha1` API version and `ConnectorCatalog` kind.
2. Match each application requirement to an exact catalog capability name and
   kind: Trigger, query, mutation, or UI unit. Record missing capabilities
   separately; one matching operation does not imply that the rest exist.
3. Use the selected entry's `directory` and `version` to form the component tag
   `<directory>/<version>`. Verify that the published tag exists.
4. Inspect `<directory>/connector.yaml` at that immutable tag. Confirm the
   complete auth and configuration contract, input and output types, branches,
   idempotency, execution policy, Trigger schema, UI units, and generated Go
   package before writing application code.
5. Record the catalog URL, connector ID, exact capabilities, component tag, and
   immutable manifest URL in the connector capability matrix.

If the catalog, tag, or immutable manifest cannot be read or validated, stop
connector-dependent implementation and report the verification blocker. Do not
silently use the repository's `main` branch, install the provider's SDK, create
an application-local webhook, or claim that a connector capability exists.

## Runtime boundary

Credentials belong to Connector Runtime, never Flow state, IDs, logs, browser code, or generated values. A Flow stores a logical connection ID and domain correlation data.

Every operation-specific factory in a configurable Go Flow also declares a static `ConnectionName`. It must match the generated Connection's runtime name. Dex Web uses connector ID plus connection name as the local identity and blocks writes when one identity resolves to different module versions.

A Connector Step emits only the current Query or Mutation result. Generated aliases such as `ListThreadMessagesResult` and `PostThreadReplyResult` are non-recursive aliases of `sdkgo.QueryResult` or `sdkgo.MutationResult`. `MapToOperationInput` is a pure mapping from the current application Step input into provider input; it does not return an error, and the application input is not copied into the result. Persist domain context in an application-owned Attribute before invoking the Connector Step. Use `Annotations` only for graph group and explanation metadata.

`ResultAttribute` is optional for every Query and Mutation. Omit it when the branch target is the only consumer because the same result already crosses the durable Step transition. Configure and register the typed Attribute only when an RPC, display, audit, recovery operator, or another path must read the raw provider result outside that transition chain.

Trigger processing verifies and normalizes the inbound event, preserves its stable provider event ID, and delivers it at least once. The connector does not classify a Trigger as Flow-start or RPC delivery.

The application supplies a `TriggerFilter` and `FlowIDResolver`. It chooses `NewDexFlowTriggerTarget` with a typed Flow and `FlowInputMapper` to start a Flow, or `NewDexRPCTriggerTarget` with a typed RPC definition and `RPCInputMapper` to invoke an existing Flow. Never route through a configurable RPC-name string or require an application RPC to accept the raw provider event.

The application filter runs before Flow ID resolution, input mapping, or a Dex call. Returning false consumes an irrelevant event. Filter, resolver, and mapper callbacks are deterministic, side-effect-free pure functions without error results. Reject events missing routing fields in the filter; a blank or invalid resolved Flow ID is an application defect. Provider matcher configuration can reduce inbound traffic, but the application filter remains the final admission boundary for channel, sender, message content, tenant, authorization, and other domain rules.

Flow starts reuse the provider event ID as the request ID. The resolved Flow ID owns root-event deduplication. For RPC delivery, register the application's bound method with application-owned `dex.RPCOptions` and pass that method directly to the target. The application owns redelivery policy, bounded deduplication state when needed, and locks for the exact business state or effect that must commit atomically.

Query and Mutation run from `Execute`. Mutation supplies a stable idempotency key. If the result is uncertain, persist that outcome and query before retrying. Do not let Trigger source handlers mutate Dex primitives directly.

## Application composition

Prefer an existing released connector capability over application-local
provider code at every external boundary.

| Application need | Connector capability | Composition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider read or write during a Flow | Query or Mutation | Use the operation-specific factory as a Connector Step; the provider call runs in `Execute`. |
| External event starts work | Trigger | Bind `NewDexFlowTriggerTarget` to the typed Flow, filter, stable Flow ID resolver, and input mapper. |
| External event updates existing work | Trigger | Bind `NewDexRPCTriggerTarget` to the registered typed RPC, filter, Flow ID resolver, and input mapper. |
| User/API RPC requests provider work | Query or Mutation plus application RPC | The RPC validates and commits application state, then returns a movement to a Connector Step; it does not call the provider. |
| Provider-aware setup | UI | Compose released UI units with generated constants and static connection/binding names. |

Inspect the release-tagged connector manifest for the exact operation or
Trigger; the presence of the provider's connector alone does not prove that the
required capability exists. Do not bypass a suitable connector with a direct
provider SDK, custom webhook, generic HTTP call, or application-specific
credential store.

## Text generation

Text generation with OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini uses the `llm` connector
(`connectors/superdurable/llm`, package `llmrouter`). Its `generateText` Query
runs each provider connector's released Query, and its model picker merges the
providers' live model lists, so a new lab model needs no code or release. Use a
provider's own connector only for a provider-native operation, a
provider-specific setting, or a lab `llm` does not route.

| User intent | Composition |
| --- | --- |
| Generic, such as "summarize with an LLM" | `llm` Step with the model picker; `Model` is the Step's pick. |
| Named model, such as "use Claude Opus" | Keep the picker and fall back in code: `cmp.Or(pick, "anthropic/<exact-model-id>")`. Take the ID from the user or the provider connector's README; never invent one. |
| Named provider only, such as "use Claude" | `cmp.Or(pick, "anthropic")` |
| Provider-native feature or unrouted lab | The provider's own connector. |

One `llm` connection holds every provider the application uses: in Dex Web
**Connectors**, the user adds each provider with its own key, then picks the
connection's default model from the added providers' live lists. A Step pick
overrides that default, and a blank connection model uses the first added
provider's default model. A model whose provider the connection has not added
selects `defect` with no request.

A model is `provider/model` or a provider alone; a bare model ID selects
`defect`. Keep requests portable by leaving `Temperature` and
`ReasoningEffort` unset and `MaxOutputTokens` zero or generous. Do not add a
per-run model to start input unless the user asks, because anyone who can
start the Flow could then bill any provider the connection reaches. Model
provider failover as Flow branches. Follow the release-tagged connector README
for the connection, key fields, and exact API.

## UI and live state

Connector UI components are application components, not new Dex primitives. Browser code uses the application API or typed Flow RPCs.

Use a durable snapshot RPC for canonical state. Streams may improve live presentation but are best-effort; reconnect through the durable snapshot rather than treating retained Stream data as authoritative.

## Local development configuration

Dex Web v2 configures exact official Connector module releases only from loopback **dexcli dev** with local Flow definitions. It verifies release metadata and the Studio bundle before loading the bundle in an opaque-origin sandbox. When no bundle exists, the host renders the manifest form.

Flow Definition Graph metadata exposes each static Trigger binding even though its runner lives outside the Flow. A binding is identified by connector ID, connection name, Trigger name, and binding name. Its provider matcher belongs to that binding, not to the reusable connection.

The default store is `~/.dex/connectors/connections.json`. Use `dexcli dev --connector-config-dir DIRECTORY` to isolate a stack; Dex Web always displays the resolved absolute file path. The file contains plaintext development credentials, so never commit, upload, log, or copy it into Flow state.

Start the Go application with the path shown by Dex Web:

```bash
DEX_CONNECTOR_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.dex/connectors/connections.json" <your-app-command>
```

Load the store once with the Connector SDK `localconfig` package and create each generated connection with `NewLocalConnection(store, connectionName)`. Generated Trigger factories decode their named binding separately and wrap the target in a binding-specific disk inbox. A matched event is persisted before provider acknowledgement, removed after Dex accepts it, and replayed after a process restart.

Configuration is fixed at application startup. Credentials are reread for every provider call, so reauthorization takes effect without an application restart. Dex Web and application restarts preserve the JSON file. Restarting Dex Web clears only pending OAuth/PKCE exchanges, submitted client secrets, and UI sessions.

For a connector authorization method with a refresh driver, the local store
persists the refresh token and expiry as private `0600` credential material.
The Connector SDK resolves the latest file on every provider call, performs
single-flight on-demand refresh near expiry, atomically preserves refresh-token
rotation, and marks terminal grants such as `invalid_grant` for
reauthorization. Deleting a local credential removes only the file record; it
does not revoke the provider grant.

## Hosted configuration and credential boundary

The application release owns non-secret Connector requirements. Keep each static
connection in `dex-app.yaml`; `make superverse-release-artifacts` emits the exact
manifest, Connector/environment contracts and strict FDG. Auth selections,
configuration values, API keys, OAuth tokens and webhook secrets do not belong
in source, generated artifacts or Flow state.

The target's authenticated management host validates configuration against those
exact requirements and stores ordinary settings separately from credentials.
Standalone Dex Web remains available. A hosting platform may instead put all
management UI in Studio and the adapted configuration/OAuth API in its existing
Go server, with direct public SDK calls to engine-only Dex `api,interpreter`
services. Do not require a management iframe, shared UI package, separate Dex Web
runtime or second Go bootstrap in that platform path. Preserve the chosen host's
scope, source revision, actor and instance admission checks. Git, Release and
deployment lifecycle belong to the hosting platform, not the open-source engine.

Use the official Connector SDK's versioned project configuration protocol. The
[SDK v0.17.0 loader](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/blob/sdkgo/v0.17.0/sdkgo/projectconfig/environment.go)
and [storage contract](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/blob/sdkgo/v0.17.0/sdkgo/projectconfig/README.md)
are the authority for this boundary. This reference version does not authorize
upgrading an application's accepted template or Connector pins; inspect its
existing bootstrap and report a compatibility blocker if the required supported
loader is absent.

`projectconfig.LoadFromEnvironment` uses AWS's default rotating credential chain
and reads the exact accepted ordinary snapshot without credential reads or provider
refresh at startup. Trusted deployment configuration supplies:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DEX_PROJECT_ID` | Fixed project identity. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_SCOPE` | `live` or `preview`. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_SESSION_ID` | Required for Preview; absent for Live. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_CONFIG_KEY` | Exact `projects/<projectID>/live/configuration/head` or `projects/<projectID>/preview/<sessionID>/configuration/head`. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_CONFIG_VERSION` | Exact immutable object version, never latest. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_CONFIG_DIGEST` | `sha256:<hex>` over the accepted object bytes. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Private versioned bucket. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_STORAGE_PREFIX` | Optional fixed outer environment prefix. |
| `DEX_PROJECT_STORAGE_KMS_KEY_ARN` | Exact hosted KMS key ARN; no alias. |
| `AWS_REGION` | Region for the default AWS configuration. |

Local versioned-storage testing additionally needs
`DEX_PROJECT_ALLOW_LOCAL_STORAGE=true` and an explicit supported local
`DEX_PROJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`; hosted deployments omit both. These variables
are deployment identity, not user-editable application environment fields.
Storage IAM must allow the exact configuration version, required connection
heads/private objects, conditional credential updates and referenced application
secrets. Credentials and KMS decrypt authority belong only to trusted host/SDK
processes; they are never returned to browser components or business Flow code.
There is no mounted configuration file, configuration-reader init container or
credential broker in this protocol.

Resolve the accepted application's environment through
`LoadedProject.ResolveApplicationEnvironment`, then apply it in main before
constructing business clients, Workers, HTTP servers or goroutines. Secret
references pin private immutable objects by scope, key, version and digest.
Configuration reads never load latest in place of a missing accepted version.

The official typed `projectconfig/provider` adapter resolves current connection
credentials at actual use. Business code neither reads credential objects nor
implements refresh, token exchange or token persistence. Refresh requires known
expired access credentials; unknown expiry or an unclassified HTTP 401 is not
permission to rotate. A durable CAS/fence admits one provider dispatch. Concurrent
or restarted callers join and recover a persisted immutable result; timeout,
lock expiry or response loss never grants a second dispatch. If a provider rotated
but no private result survived, require reauthorization instead of repeating the
uncertain exchange. No token or raw provider failure belongs in a Flow or log.

A settings edit creates another ordinary revision; existing deployments continue
to read their accepted version until explicitly replaced. Preview and Live use
separate scopes. Credentials remain current within one scope, so replacing a Live
API key or OAuth connection affects subsequent same-name uses across deployed
builds. Missing configuration, wrong digest/scope, unsupported capability or a
terminal refresh failure surfaces deployment-blocked or reauthorization-required
state. Verify real storage, Worker and provider behavior before handoff.

## AI agents

Agents use the same typed Query and Mutation capabilities as deterministic Steps. Dex owns durable state, approval waits, retries, reconciliation, and cleanup. Connector code does not become a second workflow engine.

## Provider classification

Every interaction with an external provider uses a dedicated connector. This
includes Trigger, Query, Mutation, and reusable integration UI. The
generic HTTP connector is permitted only for an organization-controlled
internal system after the internal-library decision below. Do not use it as an
escape hatch for external SaaS APIs.

An application-owned local artifact, such as a generated HTML file, is not a
provider interaction and needs no connector. Write it from `Execute`
idempotently (a deterministic path that a retry can safely overwrite), keep the
durable copy in an Attribute (Dex offloads large values to blob storage), and
expose the file path as a display field.

## Reuse and contribution

Inspect `https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library` and its
released component tags first. Reuse the latest compatible released dedicated
connector and every matching operation, Trigger, and UI capability before
writing application-local integration code.

For a public external product with a documented API or official SDK, a missing
connector, operation, or Trigger is a connector contribution—not permission to
call the provider directly from the application. Explain the exact capability
gap and load the sibling `dex-connector-contributor` skill completely. That
skill resolves the official repository or user's fork and loads the target
checkout's current agent rules and documentation. The connector repository then
owns manifest authoring, generated surfaces, provider tests, examples, real Dex
coverage, release ordering, and its upstream contribution workflow.

As soon as the local connector module builds, continue application verification
against its checkout through an uncommitted `go.work` or temporary Go
`replace`. Test both repositories together while the connector branch is pushed
and its upstream PR is reviewed. Never commit a branch, commit SHA,
pseudo-version, `go.work`, or local replacement as the production dependency.
Keep the connector release as a production handoff blocker. After release,
remove the override, pin its exact component tag, and rerun integration and E2E
coverage.

## Internal connector library decision

For every organization-controlled internal service, ask the user:

1. whether an internal connector library already exists and where it lives;
2. whether this application should reuse or contribute to it;
3. when none exists, whether the organization wants to establish one.

Do not infer access to a private repository or create one without authorization.
When an internal library exists, inspect its instructions, released modules,
and compatibility policy before reuse. When the user chooses to establish one,
agree on repository ownership and visibility, Go module namespace, release/tag
policy, catalog/discovery, maintainers, and CI. Build its connectors with the
same unified `sdkgo` Connector SDK, `connector.yaml` code generation,
operation-specific factories, Trigger targets, credential isolation, provider
tests, examples, and module-level releases used by the official library.

If the user declines a reusable internal library, the generic HTTP connector
may integrate that controlled internal service. Keep credentials in the
Connector Runtime, provider calls in Connector Step `Execute`, and the same
idempotency, uncertainty, retry, and real-Dex test requirements. Record the
decision and the resulting reuse limitation in the handoff.

## Released Trigger examples

Use the [Slack thread approval example](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/tree/connectors/slack/v0.11.0/connectors/slack/examples/thread-approval) for a Socket Mode root event, application-owned channel/poster/text filters, thread query, typed reply RPC, thread-reply Mutation, and composed configuration UI units.

Use the [Gmail thread reply example](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/tree/connectors/google/gmail/v0.13.0/connectors/google/gmail/examples/thread-reply) for a polled root message, application-owned sender/text filters, message query, typed reply RPC, email-reply Mutation, and composed configuration UI units. Its polling transport is a local alpha path, not a production push-delivery design.

Both examples derive one stable Flow ID from provider thread identity. They absorb root redelivery through deterministic starts, handle reply redelivery in bounded application-owned thread state, and move uncertain or rejected external writes into explicit recovery instead of blind resend.
