# Dex Connector Architecture v0

Dex Connector is an open-source full-stack integration layer for Dex ecosystem process applications and durable agents. It is not a generic API wrapper or a node-based automation library.

Version 0 supports Go plus the Dex SDK on the backend and React TypeScript for optional UI.

## Capability model

A connector may expose five capabilities:

- **Auth**: authorize and identify a logical connection.
- **Trigger**: translate an external event into a provider-neutral typed event.
- **Query**: read external state from a Step or agent tool.
- **Mutation**: change external state with idempotency and recovery.
- **UI**: reusable integration-aware React components.

Describe capabilities in a machine-readable `connector.yaml` catalog. Agents inspect the catalog before inventing integration code.

## Runtime boundary

Credentials belong to Connector Runtime, never Flow state, IDs, logs, browser code, or generated values. A Flow stores a logical connection ID and domain correlation data.

Every operation-specific factory in a configurable Go Flow also declares a static `ConnectionName`. It must match the generated Connection's runtime name. Dex Web uses connector ID plus connection name as the local identity and blocks writes when one identity resolves to different module versions.

A Connector Step emits only the current Query or Mutation result. Generated aliases such as `ListThreadMessagesResult` and `PostThreadReplyResult` are non-recursive aliases of `sdkgo.QueryResult` or `sdkgo.MutationResult`. `MapToOperationInput` is a pure mapping from the current application Step input into provider input; it does not return an error, and the application input is not copied into the result. Persist domain context in an application-owned Attribute before invoking the Connector Step. Use `Annotations` only for graph group and explanation metadata.

`ResultAttribute` is optional for every Query and Mutation. Omit it when the branch target is the only consumer because the same result already crosses the durable Step transition. Configure and register the typed Attribute only when an RPC, display, audit, recovery operator, or another path must read the raw provider result outside that transition chain.

Trigger processing verifies and normalizes the inbound event, preserves its stable provider event ID, and delivers it at least once. The connector does not classify a Trigger as Flow-start or RPC delivery.

The application supplies a `TriggerFilter` and `FlowIDResolver`. It chooses `NewDexFlowTriggerTarget` with a typed Flow and `FlowInputMapper` to start a Flow, or `NewDexRPCTriggerTarget` with a typed RPC definition and `RPCInputMapper` to invoke an existing Flow. Never route through a configurable RPC-name string or require an application RPC to accept the raw provider event.

The application filter runs before Flow ID resolution, input mapping, or a Dex call. Returning false consumes an irrelevant event. Filter, resolver, and mapper callbacks are deterministic, side-effect-free pure functions without error results. Reject events missing routing fields in the filter; a blank or invalid resolved Flow ID is an application defect. Provider matcher configuration can reduce inbound traffic, but the application filter remains the final admission boundary for channel, sender, message content, tenant, authorization, and other domain rules.

Flow starts reuse the provider event ID as the request ID. The resolved Flow ID owns root-event deduplication. For RPC delivery, register the application's bound method with application-owned `dex.RPCOptions` and pass that method directly to the target. The application owns redelivery policy, bounded deduplication state when needed, and locks for the exact business state or effect that must commit atomically.

Query and Mutation run from `Execute`. Mutation supplies a stable idempotency key. If the result is uncertain, persist that outcome and query before retrying. Do not let Trigger source handlers mutate Dex primitives directly.

## Application composition

Prefer an existing released connector capability over application-local
provider code at every external boundary.

| Application need | Connector capability | Composition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider read or write during a Flow | Query or Mutation | Use the operation-specific factory as a Connector Step; the provider call runs in `Execute`. |
| External event starts work | Trigger | Bind `NewDexFlowTriggerTarget` to the typed Flow, filter, stable Flow ID resolver, and input mapper. |
| External event updates existing work | Trigger | Bind `NewDexRPCTriggerTarget` to the registered typed RPC, filter, Flow ID resolver, and input mapper. |
| User/API RPC requests provider work | Query or Mutation plus application RPC | The RPC validates and commits application state, then returns a movement to a Connector Step; it does not call the provider. |
| Provider-aware setup | UI | Compose released UI units with generated constants and static connection/binding names. |

Inspect the connector manifest for the exact operation or Trigger; the presence
of the provider's connector alone does not prove that the required capability
exists. Do not bypass a suitable connector with a direct provider SDK, custom
webhook, generic HTTP call, or application-specific credential store.

## UI and live state

Connector UI components are application components, not new Dex primitives. Browser code uses the application API or typed Flow RPCs.

Use a durable snapshot RPC for canonical state. Streams may improve live presentation but are best-effort; reconnect through the durable snapshot rather than treating retained Stream data as authoritative.

## Local development configuration

Dex Web v2 configures exact official Connector module releases only from loopback **dexcli dev** with local Flow definitions. It verifies release metadata and the Studio bundle before loading the bundle in an opaque-origin sandbox. When no bundle exists, the host renders the manifest form.

Flow Definition Graph metadata exposes each static Trigger binding even though its runner lives outside the Flow. A binding is identified by connector ID, connection name, Trigger name, and binding name. Its provider matcher belongs to that binding, not to the reusable connection.

The default store is `~/.dex/connectors/connections.json`. Use `dexcli dev --connector-config-dir DIRECTORY` to isolate a stack; Dex Web always displays the resolved absolute file path. The file contains plaintext development credentials, so never commit, upload, log, or copy it into Flow state.

Start the Go application with the path shown by Dex Web:

```bash
DEX_CONNECTOR_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.dex/connectors/connections.json" <your-app-command>
```

Load the store once with the Connector SDK `localconfig` package and create each generated connection with `NewLocalConnection(store, connectionName)`. Generated Trigger factories decode their named binding separately and wrap the target in a binding-specific disk inbox. A matched event is persisted before provider acknowledgement, removed after Dex accepts it, and replayed after a process restart.

Configuration is fixed at application startup. Credentials are reread for every provider call, so reauthorization takes effect without an application restart. Dex Web and application restarts preserve the JSON file. Restarting Dex Web clears only pending OAuth/PKCE exchanges, submitted client secrets, and UI sessions.

Local OAuth stores short-lived access tokens without refresh tokens. Reauthorize after expiry. Deleting a local credential removes only the file record; it does not revoke the provider grant.

## AI agents

Agents use the same typed Query and Mutation capabilities as deterministic Steps. Dex owns durable state, approval waits, retries, reconciliation, and cleanup. Connector code does not become a second workflow engine.

## Provider classification

Every interaction with an external provider uses a dedicated connector. This
includes Trigger, Query, Mutation, and reusable integration UI. The
generic HTTP connector is permitted only for an organization-controlled
internal system after the internal-library decision below. Do not use it as an
escape hatch for external SaaS APIs.

## Reuse and contribution

Inspect `https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library` and its
released component tags first. Reuse the latest compatible released dedicated
connector and every matching operation, Trigger, and UI capability before
writing application-local integration code.

For a public external product with a documented API or official SDK, a missing
connector, operation, or Trigger is a connector contribution—not permission to
call the provider directly from the application. Explain the exact capability
gap and load sibling `$dex-connector-contributor` completely. That skill owns
fork discovery, manifest-first authoring, generated surfaces, provider tests,
connector-local examples, real Dex coverage, release ordering, pushing the
user's fork `origin`, and the upstream PR to the official repository.

As soon as the local connector module builds, continue application verification
against its checkout through an uncommitted `go.work` or temporary Go
`replace`. Test both repositories together while the connector branch is pushed
and its upstream PR is reviewed. Never commit a branch, commit SHA,
pseudo-version, `go.work`, or local replacement as the production dependency.
Keep the connector release as a production handoff blocker. After release,
remove the override, pin its exact component tag, and rerun integration and E2E
coverage.

## Internal connector library decision

For every organization-controlled internal service, ask the user:

1. whether an internal connector library already exists and where it lives;
2. whether this application should reuse or contribute to it;
3. when none exists, whether the organization wants to establish one.

Do not infer access to a private repository or create one without authorization.
When an internal library exists, inspect its instructions, released modules,
and compatibility policy before reuse. When the user chooses to establish one,
agree on repository ownership and visibility, Go module namespace, release/tag
policy, catalog/discovery, maintainers, and CI. Build its connectors with the
same unified `sdkgo` Connector SDK, `connector.yaml` code generation,
operation-specific factories, Trigger targets, credential isolation, provider
tests, examples, and module-level releases used by the official library.

If the user declines a reusable internal library, the generic HTTP connector
may integrate that controlled internal service. Keep credentials in the
Connector Runtime, provider calls in Connector Step `Execute`, and the same
idempotency, uncertainty, retry, and real-Dex test requirements. Record the
decision and the resulting reuse limitation in the handoff.

## Released Trigger examples

Use the [Slack thread approval example](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/tree/connectors/slack/v0.9.0/connectors/slack/examples/thread-approval) for a Socket Mode root event, application-owned channel/poster/text filters, thread query, typed reply RPC, thread-reply Mutation, and composed configuration UI units.

Use the [Gmail thread reply example](https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/tree/connectors/google/gmail/v0.10.0/connectors/google/gmail/examples/thread-reply) for a polled root message, application-owned sender/text filters, message query, typed reply RPC, email-reply Mutation, and composed configuration UI units. Its polling transport is a local alpha path, not a production push-delivery design.

Both examples derive one stable Flow ID from provider thread identity. They absorb root redelivery through deterministic starts, handle reply redelivery in bounded application-owned thread state, and move uncertain or rejected external writes into explicit recovery instead of blind resend.
