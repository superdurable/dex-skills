# Build, test, and handoff

## Implementation loop

Use the basic-process template's stable commands. Change `openapi/openapi.yaml`, then regenerate; never hand-edit generated Go or TypeScript clients.

Keep the template release's `go.mod`, `go.sum`, npm lockfile, Go toolchain,
Dex Server/CLI baselines, generators, and Make targets unchanged unless the
user explicitly requested the corresponding stack or dependency change. A
newer `DEX_BASELINE` in the skill repository is not an application upgrade
instruction.

For **No custom UI**, reduce OpenAPI to `GetApplicationInfo` plus confirmed integration ingress, regenerate both clients, and remove process-management routes and mock lifecycle code. Verify the Hello World page through the generated client. Do not run a mock approval checkpoint for an inert shell.

For **Custom UI**, use `make mock` as the interaction-approval loop and run `make test-mock-e2e` after UI behavior changes. Run the narrowest relevant unit or frontend check after each edit batch. Before handoff run the repository's full `make check`, including mock E2E, real Dex integration and E2E, Worker replacement, FDG 2.0 validation, and the production build.

Treat mock results as HTTP/UI evidence only. They cannot establish Dex durability, Worker replacement, Timer, RPC, retry, or provider semantics.

Show Dex Web early. Once the first Flow graph renders, keep one user-facing `dexcli dev` stack running with a persistent `--flow-rendering-dir`, stable ports, and persistent state, and give the user its URL before continuing. Then keep implementing and testing against isolated test stacks. Do not wait until verification passes to start it, and do not let test scripts reuse or stop it. Report its URL again at handoff.

## Baselines and local CLI

Advance these template pins together; `internal/templatecontract/contract_test.go` hard-codes the template's own values (`server/v0.12.0`, `cli-v0.12.0`, `sdk-go v0.11.3`, and the skill submodule commit in template `v0.2.1`), so changing only some of them fails `make check`:

- `DEX_SERVER_BASELINE` and `DEX_CLI_BASELINE`;
- the `github.com/superdurable/dex/sdk-go` requirement in `go.mod`;
- the `.agents/skills` submodule pin;
- the expectations in the template contract test.

Template scripts call `dexcli` from `PATH` and do not check its version. Run `dexcli version` first and require at least `v0.13.8`. When upgrading the global CLI would break other projects pinned to older Servers, install a project-local CLI and put its directory first on `PATH` for the template commands; `scripts/check-fdg-v2.sh` also honors `DEXCLI`.

Validate every Flow file, not only the template's `internal/process/flow.go`; see [Dex Web v2 validation](dex-web-v2.md#validation).

## Durable verification

Use a real Dex Server when behavior crosses a Client, Worker, wait, RPC, Channel, Timer, Stream, retry, provider, or process boundary.

Cover:

- start and typed terminal output;
- duplicate start/request behavior;
- durable wait and Worker replacement;
- Action eligibility, valid action, duplicate/late action, and terminal rejection;
- role-to-permission mapping, unauthorized Action rejection, and multi-permission work discovery at the application boundary;
- concurrent Action-source writes without projection-only locks and cumulative permission history after state changes and completion;
- retry and exhausted-recovery behavior;
- provider idempotency and unknown-outcome reconciliation;
- summary/display reads before, during, and after terminal completion;
- connector Trigger Flow/RPC routing and correlation when used.
- RPC-to-Connector-Step routing when an application RPC requests provider work;
- application integration against any uncommitted local connector `replace`,
  plus the matching connector module's provider and real-Dex tests.

For a No custom UI application, also assert that no approval, display, status,
list, search, detail, retry, escalation, Action-proxy, or Attribute-proxy HTTP
route remains. Test each retained webhook independently from Dex Web management.

Use deadline-based polling and report Flow IDs and status on failure. Do not hide or skip a failing check.

## Handoff

Ensure:

- `superverse.yaml` and `.superverse/template.json` remain valid;
- application dependencies, runtime baselines, lockfiles, and commands still
  match the pinned template unless an explicit user-approved deviation is
  recorded;
- the confirmed UI mode is recorded;
- a No custom UI shell contains no business controls or management routes;
- custom UI interactions are approved against the mock server and Mock Controls;
- secrets are absent from files, logs, generated values, and archives;
- dependencies and released connector versions are pinned;
- every public-provider boundary reuses an available released connector
  capability or records the contributor PR and release blocker;
- every internal-service boundary records the existing/new internal connector
  library decision or the reason generic HTTP remains appropriate;
- each configurable Connector Step has a static connection name matching its generated Connection;
- each Connector Step branch receives only its current operation result, while application Attributes retain domain context;
- every Connector factory uses pure `MapToOperationInput` and graph-only `Annotations`;
- each Connector Trigger binding has a static binding name, application-owned Flow ID resolver, and typed target;
- the displayed local connection path and **DEX_CONNECTOR_CONFIG_FILE** launch command work after a Dex Web restart;
- connector fork/PR status and any release blocker are explicit;
- no `go.work`, local `replace`, branch, pseudo-version, or commit SHA remains
  in the production dependency graph;
- the repository has a clean, reviewable commit;
- limitations and unimplemented integrations are explicit.

Dex AI Platform upload is not available yet. State that the repository is ready for future import only when no connector release blocker remains. Do not invent an upload command, deployment URL, or success result.
