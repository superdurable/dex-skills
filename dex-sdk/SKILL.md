# Dex SDK

Build reliable applications through Dex's public programming model. Keep the user's experience in Dex terms and APIs.

## Session start

Before the first substantive Dex-related response, follow the shared
[Dex Skills version check](references/core/plugin-version-check.md). Prefer the
lifecycle hook status; run the Skill fallback only when that status is
`unavailable` or absent. Run it only once and never delay or block the task.

## Stay at the application boundary

- Model behavior with Flows, Steps, Waits, Attributes, Channels, Streams, RPCs, Timers, SubFlows, Workers, and the Client.
- Use Dex Web, dexcli, SDK errors, and application logs for inspection and recovery.
- Use typed Flow RPCs as the application boundary for reading and writing Attributes, AttributeMaps, Channels, and ChannelMaps. Do not use removed Client state APIs. Attribute match remains the blocking observation API.
- Do not expose Dex Server internals as application requirements. Discuss them only when the user explicitly asks to develop Dex itself.
- Diagnose read-only by default. Do not stop, time travel, publish, invoke, delete, edit, or otherwise mutate a Flow unless the user authorizes it.

## Establish source authority

Before writing code, identify the language, package manager, installed Dex SDK version, registry, Worker and Client bootstrap, and repository test commands.

Preserve the installed SDK version unless the user asks to upgrade. Pinned source excerpts retain the exact baseline names, including older `CustomKeyword` slots or implicit index keys. They demonstrate API shapes; new application indexes must follow the generic numbered-slot policy in [core primitives](references/core/primitives.md#attribute). The project's source, lockfile, installed SDK, and version-matched examples are authoritative. This bundle's exact API excerpts are pinned to the immutable release tag in their visible source links and recorded in the source repository's `DEX_BASELINE`; use them as guidance, not as evidence that a different installed version has the same signature.

Read the installed release metadata from [VERSION](VERSION) and the complete
set of source pins from [bundle baselines](references/core/bundle-baselines.md).
These files are included in Plugin and standalone installations.

If the project version differs from the baseline, name the matching installed-source path or immutable tag/commit used before writing exact API code. If that source is unavailable, stop at the version-independent Flow model, identify what is needed, and ask to inspect or fetch it. Never claim verification without an auditable version-matched source, label baseline syntax as compatible with an unverified version, or invent a Dex API.

Check for a superseded copy of this skill. `dex-developer` is its former name. A direct install such as `~/.claude/skills/dex-developer`, or one added with `npx skills`, is not updated by the plugin and can remain the Dex skill that loads, with older pinned Server and CLI releases. When a `dex-developer` skill is also available, tell the user to remove that direct install, install `superdurable-dex@superdurable`, and start a new session; do not delete it yourself. When `dexcli version` is newer than the source repository's `DEX_CLI_BASELINE`, say that the loaded guidance may trail the installed CLI and suggest updating the plugin.

## Load references progressively

Always read the entry page for the project's language first:

- [Python](references/python/python.md)
- [Go](references/go/go.md)
- [Java](references/java/java.md)
- [TypeScript](references/typescript/typescript.md)
- [Rust](references/rust/rust.md)

Before writing or reviewing any Client boundary—including Flow start, RPC, cleanup, admission, waits, or external Stream writes—read [Error handling](references/core/error-handling.md) and the selected language's **error-handling.md**. This is implementation guidance; do not defer it until a failure needs troubleshooting.

For mutations followed by reads or completion checks, also read [Read-after-write consistency](references/core/read-after-write.md). Classify the write/read pair. Direct Temporal RPC state readback is strong; search/projections and triggered business work have separate confirmation boundaries. Do not require polling or callbacks merely because a write uses Signal.

Then load only the references required by the task:

| Task | Core reference | Language reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First application or architecture | [Getting started](references/core/getting-started.md) and [Error handling](references/core/error-handling.md) | language entry and **error-handling.md** |

| Cancellation, BlobCache, or other advanced behavior | relevant core topic | selected language's **advanced-features.md** |

The language directory is the routing unit. Do not load all five languages.

## Model before implementation

For non-trivial work, first state the Flow identity and lifecycle, typed start input and completion output, Steps and transitions, Flow-level durability default, method-level StepOptions, durable state, messages, synchronous RPCs, best-effort Streams, timers, retries, timeouts, recovery, and SubFlow boundaries.

Name every RPC handler and explicit RPC with a concrete action verb. Use complete domain names such as `get_queued_messages` or `move_queued_message_to_prioritized_messages`, not noun-only names, placeholders, or generic names such as `Get`, `Update`, `Manager`, `Data`, or `Handler`. Apply the same preference for complete, precise names to APIs, interfaces, classes, types, methods, functions, fields, variables, and constants. Brevity is not a goal; a name should communicate its operation and subject at the call site or registration boundary.

Use **Execute** for work-oriented transitions and **WaitFor** for durable waiting transitions. This is a modeling convention, not an SDK capability boundary: either phase may query or mutate an external provider when that is necessary to establish or reconcile its transition. Keep every external mutation idempotent or compensatable, including mutations made from `WaitFor`; do not turn `WaitFor` into an unbounded provider-polling loop when a durable Attribute, Channel, Stream, or Timer can express the wait.

Treat each WaitFor, Execute, and RPC invocation as a separate commit boundary. Split a provider action into its own Step when its successful completion deserves an independent checkpoint, retry/timeout policy, failure-recovery route, or audit boundary. For example, an idempotent Kafka or SQS send often merits its own Step so later failures do not resend it. Do not split solely because there is another API call: keep consecutive work in one Step when it shares one meaningful recovery boundary.

For a product mutation that entails multiple actions, cross-service calls, durable waits, retries, reconciliation, or cleanup, prefer starting one domain-named Dex Flow directly at the API boundary. Let that Flow own admission, orchestration, recovery, completion, and the durable process state that Dex can model. Never chain dependent StartFlow calls for that operation in the API handler, including a read/status branch between starts; follow [durable downstream-start ownership](references/core/modeling.md#own-downstream-starts-durably). Do not introduce a database outbox plus dispatcher, polling command queue, or generic event-driven coordinator solely to start or sequence the Flow. A single bounded local operation can remain synchronous, and independently owned external integrations may still require explicit events.

### Flow boundary default

Default a new design to no SubFlows. Use parallel Steps when work shares one
Flow identity and lifecycle. Create another top-level Flow only for a distinct
data owner and retention/cleanup lifecycle with its own waits, Timers, and
terminal outcomes; start it independently and coordinate through typed RPCs or
Channels. A separate top-level Flow is not a SubFlow.

Before proposing any SubFlow, read [Flow
modeling](references/core/modeling.md) and [pattern
selection](references/core/patterns.md). SubFlows are an explicitly confirmed
evolution after concrete single-Flow complexity or a fan-out beyond the
200-concurrent-Step architecture-review threshold. Code reuse, provider
abstraction, retry policy, or ordinary parallelism is not sufficient.

### Dex-first state ownership

Default durable application state to typed Flow Attributes and AttributeMaps,
not to a new database dependency. Prefer a stable domain/entity Flow when Dex
can own facts shared by multiple processes; cross-Flow reuse is an
ownership-design question, not by itself a storage gap. Use indexed Attributes
and Dex search for supported lookup paths, typed RPCs for reads and mutations,
Channels for queued intent, bounded AttributeMap chunks or partitions for
growing collections, and Dex blob storage for large values. Assign application indexes explicit
generic typed slots shared across Flow types; keep business names on Attributes.
Application run searches constrain FlowType and exclude ContinuedAsNew runs;
see [core primitives](references/core/primitives.md#attribute).
For map-wide write invariants, follow the singleton coordination-lock pattern in
[data handling](references/core/data-handling.md#whole-map-coordination).

Introduce an external database or search store only for a confirmed access or
scale requirement Dex cannot reasonably satisfy: complex/ad-hoc indexes,
full-text or vector search, sustained high-contention reads and writes to one
hot record, relational joins or multi-record transactions, or large analytical
scans. First consider a Dex Attribute Store projection when Dex can remain the
authority and only the query shape is missing. Never create ambiguous dual
authority: identify the source of truth per fact and define synchronization,
failure, and reconciliation behavior.

Call StartFlow first; never add a preflight read RPC, search, or status lookup solely to avoid retry/AlreadyStarted edge cases. Follow the [start identity and error-handling rule](references/core/error-handling.md#start-first-reconcile-only-after-an-error), including a stable Request ID plus the ignore-already-started option for attachable retries. On success, return the accepted response from known validated request fields; do not reread identity or initial Attributes, or use an immediate snapshot to choose the next start.

Deduplicate root Flow starts with Dex start identity, not an application-owned database mechanism. Derive a stable Flow ID for the logical operation, derive the start Request ID from the complete logical request, choose the explicit ID reuse policy, and handle the SDK's typed already-started result. Never add a table, row, outbox, lease, lock, cache, or generic admission projection solely to deduplicate or serialize `startFlow`. If the API must confirm durable admission, wait for the admission Step or Flow result and read accepted business state from its owning domain record.

At application boundaries, preserve typed Dex failures until domain policy can distinguish business rejection, a closed-Flow race, a retryable service failure, and a local defect. Reconcile a not-active result from existing authoritative state; inspect the Flow only when an otherwise unknown terminal distinction changes the outcome. Use retained Streams only for best-effort observation, never as authoritative business state.

For terminal business reads, apply the [terminal read RPC rule](references/core/error-handling.md#terminal-read-rpc-rule): inspect RPC options and handler effects, read retained state through a typed read-only RPC, and never replace that snapshot with historical Step-output decoding. Verify this path with the [terminal entity read integration scenario](references/core/testing.md#terminal-entity-reads).

Prefer the nearest official pattern to an ad hoc coordination loop. Preserve its Flow shape while replacing the domain and integrations. When changing a Go or Python Flow, use `dexcli visualize SOURCE` after the shape is explicit; the visualizer does not currently support Java, TypeScript, or Rust. In standalone development, as soon as the first graph renders, write it to a `--flow-rendering-dir`, start a long-lived `dexcli dev` for the user with that directory, and share the Dex Web URL before continuing; keep it running while you implement and test on separate isolated stacks. A platform with existing Studio Design/Preview uses that host instead of starting a second management stack.

## Complete the vertical slice

Application changes should include typed inputs, outputs, and failures; Flow and Step definitions; every persistence schema entry; constructor-injected dependencies; registry wiring; Worker and Client wiring when absent; an application boundary; and a real Dex Server integration test.

Keep stable Flow, Step, Attribute, Channel, Stream, and RPC names compatible with open executions unless the user has an explicit migration. Use unique Flow IDs and convergence polling rather than fixed sleeps.

Before handoff, verify build or type-check, the relevant integration scenario, registration of every durable primitive, retry and timeout recovery, duplicate requests, terminal behavior, heartbeat cadence, Stream best-effort semantics, and compatible Worker/Client registry and payload configuration.
