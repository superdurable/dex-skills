# Changelog

## 0.34.2 - 2026-10-09

- Pin Server guidance to server/v1.5.1 and CLI guidance to cli-v1.6.3; refresh source links while retaining the released SDK API baseline.
- Explain RPC payload persistence in Core and all five language references: nontransactional inputs/outputs use direct transport, returned state changes remain eligible for Blob Store, and transactional payloads are persisted. A read-only handler can still be transactional.
- Document RPC transport limits, consistent Worker size errors, and removal of api.includeRPCInputOutputIntoHistory from existing configuration.
- Correct the Flow-boundary guidance so it no longer claims nontransactional read RPC payloads are persisted.
- Replace retired hosted Web configuration, trusted-header, and start-admission guidance with the supported local Connector and application access boundaries. Validate the current released interfaces.
- Synchronize Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor manifests at version 0.34.2.

## 0.34.1 - 2026-10-08

- Check start payloads against the registered starting Step before implementation and tests; use the SDK no-input contract when no payload is needed, including Go dex.None with nil. Distinguish local input validation from Server admission and retry outcomes.
- Trace shared helper effects and keep Step Stream writes and buffered writers in Step invocations; route RPC and timeout output through durable state or a next Step.
- Make method-specific map and pending-Channel load hints visible before coding, with Core and all five language references kept in sync.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor manifests at version 0.34.1. Existing released SDK, Server, and CLI source pins stay unchanged.

## 0.34.0 - 2026-10-07

- Add a fourth Flow-boundary question to Core modeling and App Builder product discovery: would the split make the Flows exchange RPCs or Channel messages on frequent events, such as every operation, external callback or poll? A yes rules the split out, because every call between Flows adds to both Flows' history and every RPC, including a read-only one, is a separate engine operation with its own latency and cost. The example is a separate Flow that tracks another Flow's inactivity, which needs a message from every operation; that deadline belongs in the Flow where the operations happen. Calls between Flows stay fine for rare events.
- Add the rule to the App Builder entrypoint, a column for messages per frequent event to the Flow-boundary table, the messages each business event causes to the business contract, and a check to the build handoff and the modeling review checklist.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.34.0.

## 0.33.0 - 2026-10-06

- Propose a Dex redesign automatically. The inventory drafts the workflow's intent contract and detects n8n shapes that Dex primitives express better (per-entity Flows instead of schedule polling, cancellable waits, Polling Steps, Dex Web Actions for approvals, Flow identity instead of state tables, per-item recovery, parallel joins, structured generation, typed configuration, collapsed glue nodes) plus source defects worth fixing, as `P` rows. Workflow import then asks the user once whether to optimize for Dex with those improvements or keep the exact n8n behavior and migrate first, together with the remaining facts and their defaults, instead of asking question by question.
- Add the intent contract draft, the `P` redesign-proposal rows (`adopted`, `deferred`, or `pending`), and a first decisions row that holds the single mode question to the n8n inventory ledger; `verify` checks `P` references, and `--strict` fails while a proposal is pending. Secure-first changes are stated for both modes instead of asked.
- Add a "Propose a Dex redesign and ask once" step to workflow import, renumber the later steps, make the design confirmation report rather than ask again, and add a redesign-pattern table to `n8n-semantics.md`.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.33.0.

## 0.32.0 - 2026-10-05

- Add an App Builder workflow for importing an exported workflow definition, starting with n8n JSON. The new `workflow-import.md` reference sets a fidelity contract: the exported configuration is the behavior authority, and every node, connection output, expression, credential, setting and export metadata field, claim, edge behavior, connector branch, and finding ends as `mapped`, `diverged`, `dropped`, `blocked`, or `pending` (a proposal awaiting the user), with no silent drops or fixes. A default or failure claim cites the n8n source at the instance's release; a claim from memory stays `blocked`. The workflow orders the work as inventory, secrets first, behavior over labels, execution-model mapping with Connector Step composition rules, released-connector mapping, golden parity, confirmation, and cutover.
- Add `n8n-semantics.md`, checked against the n8n source: export anatomy and provenance, the item model and zero-item stops, paired-item lineage, the pre-execution parameter check that fails a whole execution, fan-out order and Wait pauses, parameter expressions (n8n swallows every error except its own `ExpressionError`, and mixed templates render null and undefined as empty text), Code node item rules, IF null handling, Luxon-to-Go time mapping, schedule rules (defaults, second jitter, missed occurrences, deduplication), a node-to-Dex mapping table including Webhook, Wait, Merge, and polling, version-dependent defaults with attribution footers, and credential mapping.
- Add `dex-app-builder/scripts/n8n_inventory.py` (Python standard library). It writes a fidelity ledger (`ledger.md` and `inventory.json`) with redacted literal secrets and IDs for every row, a Mermaid graph, a connector capability matrix, a Dex plan draft that applies the composition rules, and a decisions table grouped by kind. Its findings cover secrets in requests, schedules that repeat effects, Webhook output shape, template placeholders, fan-out order, Waits that pause branches or stand in for polling, zero-item stops, first-item-only Code, locale and timezone dependence, unreachable Merge inputs, inconsistent authentication, managed credentials, hard-coded identifiers, placeholder nodes that make every execution fail, open triggers, and version defaults. `verify` fails on unresolved rows, missing generated rows, unknown decision references, placeholder rows, and `mapped` rows that rest on unverified claims, and counts rows mapped to specified behavior as conditional; `--strict` also fails on `pending` rows, and `--accept`, the cutover gate, on `blocked` rows too.
- Add `dex-app-builder/scripts/n8n_schedule_golden.mjs`, which prints a schedule's fire times, including DST days, from the `cron` package n8n's scheduler uses at the pinned version.
- Add `dex-app-builder/scripts/n8n_code_golden.mjs` and `n8n_expression_golden.mjs` (Node standard library). They capture golden output from a Code node or an expression parameter over synthetic fixtures, following n8n's item and template rules: first-item reads in all-items mode, rejected `$input.all()` in per-item mode, swallowed expression errors reported as `swallowedErrors`, empty rendering in mixed templates, an `--expression` override for a proposed fix, and a configurable Luxon location.
- Update Connector architecture: text generation follows the released `llm` connector (package `llm`, one provider per connection, unprefixed model IDs, Gemini's path-segment model rule, six routed branches); the module path comes from the connector's `go.mod` at the tag; and a local clone may supply release-tagged connector files through `git show` at the tag when the web view is unreachable.
- Tune the import over three evaluation rounds, in which fresh agents migrated four exports with only this workflow and independent judges scored the plans (average fidelity 67, then 78, then 80.5, with no high or critical misses in the last round). Every adopted fact was checked against the n8n source or the released connector SDK.
- From a first end-to-end migration: per-item processing through a Connector Step uses a persisted cursor, because Connector results carry no item context; run Flow IDs derive from the scheduler's Flow ID and the occurrence, because Flow IDs reject `/`, `$`, and `:`; a scheduler skips late occurrences and sets a long retry window on its waiting Step; and an application tests an unreleased connector through a `go.work` `replace` of the pinned version.
- Route exported-workflow requests from the App Builder entrypoint and description, and validate the new references and scripts in `check-package.py`, with unit tests on synthetic exports.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.32.0.

## 0.31.1 - 2026-10-05

- Bound every Polling wait only with the polling Step's StepOptions, which the engine enforces: the Execute method timeout is the maximum wait for one attempt, and the Execute retry total duration is the maximum wait across all attempts, measured from the first attempt and also cutting the in-flight attempt. Always set the total duration, because an omitted value uses the four-hour server default. Keep the one-minute heartbeat timeout.
- Remove the in-code business deadline from Core, the `dex-sdk` entrypoint, and the Go, Java, Python, TypeScript, and Rust Polling guidance, including the Python advice to pass an absolute deadline as Step input. The heartbeat checkpoint holds only resume state, such as the last reported status.
- Route an expired wait through each SDK's Execute-failure recovery option to a Step that reads the recovery error (detail and error type) and records the business failure; without that route the Flow fails. A non-duration business condition, such as an externally owned lease expiring, is still checked in the loop.
- Add the anti-pattern of a hand-written deadline that duplicates the method timeout or the retry total duration.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.31.1.

## 0.31.0 - 2026-10-05

- Make `dex-app-builder` a generic Dex application-building skill that depends only on open-source Dex: the Dex Go SDK, `dexcli` including `dexcli dev`, Dex Server, Dex Web, the FDG analyzer, and released official connectors. It discovers the business process, models Flows and FDG, implements a Go backend, uses Dex Web or builds a custom UI, and verifies locally.
- Replace the application-template bootstrap with a generic Go stack: an existing application keeps its pins; an empty repository gets a Go module on an exact released Dex Go SDK paired with the installed `dexcli`, checked with `dexcli version check` before connecting to a remote Server.
- Remove guidance specific to a downstream product built on Dex from App Builder and Dex SDK, including its application template contract, release and publishing semantics, and hosting-platform configuration.
- Add local verification on one long-lived `dexcli dev` stack, packaging of validated FDG 2.0 definitions for a deployed Dex Web (definition directory or atomic `active-manifest` bundle), and an on-request deployment section for the Dex Server image behind a `trusted-header` proxy with project Connector configuration.
- Remove the application template baseline mechanism: `TEMPLATE_BASELINE`, its scheduled update workflow, updater script and tests, and the template checks in `check-upstream-baselines.py`, `check-package.py`, and both CI workflows. Dex Server and CLI baseline checks remain.
- Add the open-source product boundary to the repository agent rules and contributing guide, enforced by a package check, and remove downstream product wording from the changelog history.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.31.0.

## 0.30.2 - 2026-10-05

- Describe only Dex concepts and guarantees in the skills. Remove every Continue-As-New mention from Core, the `dex-sdk` entrypoint, the Java and TypeScript versioning guidance, App Builder's Dex Web reference, and the versioning, testing, and read-after-write guidance.
- Stop telling developers to exclude `ContinuedAsNew` runs from application searches in Core primitives, Core operations, the `dex-sdk` entrypoint, and all five language data-handling references. Application run searches constrain FlowType.
- Rewrite Core read-after-write as a Dex-level guarantee table: which write/read pairs are strong, which are eventual or asynchronous, and what to do for each, without backend messaging mechanisms. State once that the strong pairs hold on Temporal-backed deployments and that Cadence-backed deployments confirm with a bounded read loop and do not support locked RPCs, Step-completion waits, or Attribute-match waits.
- Replace backend internals in application guidance with Dex behavior: RPC routing and closed-Flow rejection in Core primitives, error handling, and testing; accepted durable waits and handler generations for Step-completion and Attribute-match waits in Core and all five language references; regular Step executions in Core StepOptions; and direct-state readback in the `dex-sdk` entrypoint, App Builder handoff, and language error-handling references.
- Add the Dex concept boundary to the repository agent rules. Deployment and operations guidance keeps naming the backend and its configuration.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.30.2.

## 0.30.0 - 2026-10-04

- Replace the Timer, retry-backoff, and Iteration polling patterns with one Polling pattern: a single long-running Step's Execute owns every wait on an external system. Each round calls the provider with its own timeout, keeps “not ready” in the loop, writes a Stream frame or heartbeat, and sleeps with the language's plain sleep. The business deadline comes from the first attempt, and the Step keeps the one-minute heartbeat timeout with `interval + call timeout <= HeartbeatTimeout - 10s`.
- Forbid a WaitFor Timer plus self-`GoTo` loop, retry policy or RetryAfter as a polling loop, a loop without heartbeats or progress, an external call without its own timeout, and a page token passed to the next Step execution.
- Keep Go and Rust RetryAfter guidance as explicit backoff for transient errors, not a polling loop. Route Timer, WaitFor, and Go `time.Sleep` guidance to the Polling pattern.
- Remove the source-checked polling excerpts from Go and Rust, and link the published [Polling design pattern](https://docs.superdurable.io/design-patterns/polling). Source-checked snippets will follow once a Dex release contains the new runnable example.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.30.0.

## 0.29.26 - 2026-10-03

- Advance the Dex SDK baseline from `sdk-go/v1.2.1` to `sdk-go/v1.5.0`. Python, TypeScript, Java, and Rust sources at that tag match their v1.4.0 releases.
- Document Go SDK v1.5.0 default Flow and Step type names, which omit the Go package, the required override for generic types, and how to upgrade production Flows that use package-qualified names.
- Require a domain Flow type name such as `ApprovalFlow`, never just `Flow`, across Core and all five language references.
- Refresh pinned source links, example dependency versions, and the TypeScript concrete-error excerpt.
- Advance the Dex CLI baseline from `cli-v1.4.2` to `cli-v1.5.0`, whose FDG analyzer uses the same Go type names as Go SDK v1.5.0.
- Pair Go SDK and `dexcli` releases by naming rule, and keep applications that pin a Go SDK before v1.5.0 on a `dexcli` before v1.5.0.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.26.

## 0.29.25

- Advance the template baseline to released v1.9.6, preserving application source
  identity and canonical single-method Connector authorization IDs.

- Route Go Flow rendering, Summary/Display and Action work directly to a bounded
  FDG 2.0 authoring reference with exact field/input syntax and focused diagnostics.
- Keep one syntax reference for Dex Web, avoiding parser
  source discovery for ordinary authoring. No business-specific patterns, Flow
  lifecycle changes, database schema changes, or SDK upgrades are introduced.


All notable changes to Dex Skills are documented here.

## 0.29.24 - 2026-10-02

- Keep the App Builder entrypoint within 8 KiB and move detailed bootstrap, business, UI, backend and handoff rules into linked references with complete package membership validation.
- Use bounded catalog and exact installed-module reads, retain verified API facts, and implement before repeating already resolved discovery.
- Clear participant UI requests do not require another wireframe approval. Missing private credentials defer real execution rather than source implementation.
- Let a host commit tool own the final full source gate; generate API packages before module import resolution.

- Advance the basic-process template baseline from `v1.9.4` to `v1.9.5`.
- Require the released template to ship without project-local skills.

- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.22.

## 0.29.21 - 2026-10-02

- Advance the basic-process template baseline from `v1.9.1` to `v1.9.2`.
- Default application authoring to source checks and production builds without generated integration/browser suites, mocks, or test-framework dependencies.
- Separate source readiness from configured real execution; missing private credentials remain an explicit runtime acceptance gap, not a source handoff blocker.
- Preserve requested real acceptance, imported application tests, and the independent SDK/Connector verification scope.
- Require the released template to ship without project-local skills.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.21.

## 0.29.20 - 2026-10-02

  Server, including automatic local UI ports and accepted loopback origins.
- Link the shared codec-server guidance from all five language handbooks and
  synchronize plugin and marketplace manifests.

## 0.29.18 - 2026-10-01

- Move released Connector discovery to the application entry checkpoint, before
  low-level SDK investigation; link text-generation selection at that boundary.
- Distinguish application use of generated operation factories from provider
  protocol implementation, and separate source authoring from credential entry.
- Keep exact template, Server, CLI and SDK baselines unchanged.

## 0.29.17 - 2026-10-01

- Treat clear application requests and existing host choices as implementation
  authorization; ask only for missing user-owned business decisions.
- Separate production-source verification from real acceptance and keep
  both Go and frontend generation/build paths in the source gate.
- Distinguish connection settings, operation configuration and credential codecs
  at the official project bootstrap; retain actual dependency verification.
- Align application guidance with the template's real-dependency test policy.
- Advance the template baseline to released `v1.9.0` (`8d845f98de1fff9dde5b321d931ac1f5cdbcf085`), whose application bootstrap consumes canonical project configuration without changing the template Go or Dex SDK pins.

- Correct project-scoped application bootstrap to the released standard Connector SDK loader with trusted `DEX_PROJECT_*` scope, canonical key, exact object version/digest and AWS identity.
- Remove obsolete mounted configuration-file and credential-broker guidance; keep tokens, actual-use refresh and uncertain exchange recovery inside the official SDK boundary.
- Synchronize all five plugin/marketplace manifests.

## 0.29.15 - 2026-10-01

- Advance the immutable Server and CLI baselines to v1.3.0; retain the SDK source and application template baselines.

- Describe trusted hosted Start admission, graph-derived Start phase, fixed targets, original-operation reconciliation, and embedded mutation CSRF requirements.
- Keep recovery on the original Flow when safe; distinguish a valid time-travel boundary from a closed execution's separately authorized corrected start.
- Synchronize Core, all five language boundaries, App Builder guidance, and plugin manifests.

## 0.29.14 - 2026-09-30

- Route OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini text generation through the `llm` connector (`connectors/superdurable/llm/v0.2.0`), whose model picker reads each provider's live model list so new lab models need no application change.
- Map generic, named-model, named-provider, and provider-native LLM intents to compositions, and record that classification in the connector capability matrix.
- Describe one `llm` connection holding every added provider with its own key, a connection default model from their live lists, and `defect` for a provider the connection has not added.

## 0.29.13 - 2026-09-30

- Advance the Dex Server and CLI baselines to `v1.2.0`, whose Dex Web renames the Connections tab to **Connectors** at `/v2/connectors`, shows connectors by display name, and lets one connection hold several auth methods.
- Refresh the pinned Server and CLI source links to the `v1.2.0` tags.
- Validate the CLI baseline's renamed Connectors page source.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.13.

## 0.29.12 - 2026-09-30

- Advance the immutable SDK source baseline and all SDK source links to the published sdk-go/v1.2.1 release, which contains the five-SDK missing/inactive error rename.
- Use FlowNotActiveOrNotFoundError, Java FlowNotActiveOrNotFoundException, and Rust SdkError::FlowNotActiveOrNotFound; preserve query-only missing translation, active-required mutation interpretation, and distinct service failures.
- Distinguish the released SDK API baseline from older dependency pins retained in the tagged example manifests; require installed-version evidence before changing existing applications.
- Add exact cross-language error/source references and public-type/metadata verification; synchronize plugin manifests while retaining Server, CLI, and template baselines.

## 0.29.11 - 2026-09-30

- Keep Go SDK-derived Flow/Step type names; allow custom GetFlowType/GetStepType only for unavoidable renames of production definitions while preserving their existing durable identities.
- Remove the blanket Dex Web type-name override workaround and route metadata mismatches to analyzer/SDK diagnosis.
- Add old-execution rollout verification for that exception and synchronize plugin manifests without changing dependency baselines.

## 0.29.10 - 2026-09-30

- Map typed missing/not-active failures directly to the business Get contract's not-found result only for confirmed query-only RPCs; retained closed executions remain readable.
- Prohibit lifecycle probes, short-timeout waits, retries, and history lookups solely to distinguish missing from closed on that read path, while preserving active-only mutation semantics and genuine service failures.
- Add real-server missing-target verification and synchronize core, all five language error references, and plugin manifests without changing dependency baselines.

## 0.29.9 - 2026-09-30

- Document Signal acceptance, strong Temporal RPC direct-state readback, eventual search/projection visibility, and asynchronous business completion as separate contracts.
- Add a version-pinned write/read matrix with backend, lifecycle, delayed-start, Worker-routing, timeout, and retry limits; require it at relevant SDK and application boundaries.
- Require first-read integration assertions for strong paths and controlled completion/projection gates for asynchronous behavior.
- Extend source validation across SDK, Server, and CLI baselines; synchronize Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor manifests without advancing dependency pins.

## 0.29.8 - 2026-09-30

- Require an Attribute-match or Step-completion wait after a successful or deduplicated start only when the response promises a critical business milestone, such as a committed database source-of-truth write.
- Keep acceptance-only starts free of waits; define post-commit markers, bounded wait outcomes, and real-server verification for both new and deduplicated starts.
- Synchronize core and all five language error-handling references and plugin manifests without changing dependency baselines.

## 0.29.7 - 2026-09-30

- Return accepted-start responses from validated request/known initial fields without defensive post-success identity or Attribute rereads; distinguish acknowledgement from explicit admission/completion results.
- Require the owning Flow to durably sequence dependent work, with downstream starts in Execute and crash recovery across acceptance/Step commit instead of API-side start/read/start orchestration.
- Require StartFlow before any retry-protection read RPC, search, or status lookup; reconcile only after a relevant failure and preserve reads independently required by the business response contract.
- Clarify the Request ID/ignore-already-started result matrix, SDK-generated IDs, bounded replay after unknown acceptance, and real-server call-order verification.
- Promote terminal read-only RPC semantics to an explicit SDK error-handling rule and design-review gate, including registration/invocation locks, transactions, handler effects, Server policy, and retention boundaries.
- Prohibit business snapshot fallbacks through `FlowNotActiveError`, `WaitForFlow`, and historical Step-output decoding; preserve explicit engine-status, completion-output, and mutation-reconciliation uses.
- Require real Dex/Temporal post-closure typed snapshot reads with assertions that the application read uses no lifecycle/history fallback, and link App Builder verification to the shared SDK guidance.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor manifests; dependency baselines are unchanged.

## 0.29.4 - 2026-09-29

- Require application run searches to constrain FlowType and exclude ContinuedAsNew runs, matching Dex Web's visibility filter.
- Preserve both predicates when composing caller filters with OR; reserve continued-run searches for explicit execution-chain inspection.
- Synchronize SDK core, five language references, and plugin manifests at version 0.29.4 without changing source baselines.

## 0.29.3 - 2026-09-29

- Require explicit generic numbered Search Attribute slots shared across Flow types, while retaining business names on Attributes and reserving Dex system indexes.
- Document singleton bool coordination Attributes for map-wide write invariants, including participation by all writers, independent loading, and SDK-managed lock ownership.
- Synchronize core and all five language references without changing pinned baseline source excerpts.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.2.

## 0.29.1 - 2026-09-29

- Advance the Dex Server and CLI baselines to `v1.1.2` for release-scoped hosted Connector setup commands.

- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.29.0.

## 0.28.2 - 2026-09-28

- Default new Flow designs to parallel Steps and require an evidence-backed, explicitly confirmed evolution gate before introducing SubFlows.
- Separate independent top-level Flows by authoritative owner, retention and cleanup, waits, Timers, terminal outcomes, and state-pollution risk.
- Start App Builder authorization design with one `admin` role while retaining granular Action permissions and requiring evidence for every additional role.
- Add generic regression assertions for authoritative versus temporary lifecycle state, typed cross-Flow coordination, and the distinction between top-level Flows and SubFlows.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.28.2.

## 0.28.1 - 2026-09-28

- Reduce Dex Connector Contributor to a thin official-repository bootstrap that loads the target checkout's current agent rules, documentation, and acceptance criteria.
- Move connector implementation, configuration, checked-in example, live-provider verification, release, and pull-request authority to `superdurable/dex-connectors-library` instead of shipping a duplicate snapshot.
- Remove the Connector Contributor references, connector snapshot baseline, source-excerpt checker, and corresponding CI checkout.

## 0.28.0 - 2026-09-28

- Require connector contributors to audit every authorization, operation, and Trigger configuration field exposed by every runnable example.
- Require provider start URLs, exact page paths, value provenance, formats, units, secrecy, blank behavior, derived claims, read-only pickers, and contextual UI-unit descriptions.
- Document Dex Web parenthesized manifest defaults and prevent applications from reintroducing free-text fields for provider-derived values.
- Advance Dex Server and CLI baselines to `v0.14.1`, the basic-process template baseline to `v1.7.2`, and the connector snapshot to Slack `v0.11.0`.

- Treat generated Go and TypeScript OpenAPI clients as ignored local build outputs that never enter application commits or pull requests.
- Replace the default application-level mock backend with component-level generated-client mocks and narrowly scoped Playwright request interception for browser-only edge cases.
- Require real Dex, Connector, and application E2E evidence while removing `make check-generated`, `make mock`, and `make test-mock-e2e` from App Builder guidance.
- Synchronize the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor plugin manifests at version 0.27.0.

## 0.26.0 - 2026-09-27

- Require App Builder discovery to map every management operation to Dex Web v2 before choosing a custom UI.
- Define Runs, Indexed Attributes, Summary RPCs, Display RPCs, Action metadata, Work Queue, editable scalars, timeline, and graph views as the native management surface.
- Require every Custom UI decision to record a specific Dex Web v2 capability gap instead of treating the need for an admin backend as sufficient.
- Document optional QR capture for user-sourced string Action inputs, including manual fallback, secure-context and embedding policy, resource cleanup, and unchanged authorization and submission semantics.
- Clarify across Core and all five language handbooks that the current FDG 2.0 management-interface analyzer reads Go source.
- Advance the Dex Server baseline to `server/v0.14.0`, Dex CLI baseline to `cli-v0.14.0`, and basic-process template baseline to `v1.6.2`.
