# Repository workflow

Contribute through the user's GitHub fork of the official
`superdurable/dex-connectors-library` repository. Treat the GitHub fork and the
local clone as separate steps.

## Fork discovery and user handoff

Before changing files, look for an existing user-owned fork in this order:

1. reuse a fork URL already verified in the current task or conversation;
2. inspect relevant local Git remotes for a user-owned repository whose GitHub
   parent is `superdurable/dex-connectors-library`;
3. inspect the authenticated GitHub account's repositories with read-only
   GitHub tooling and verify the candidate's parent repository.

Do not guess a GitHub username or treat an arbitrary repository with the same
name as a fork. Verify its GitHub parent. Do not expose tokens or other
authentication details while inspecting remotes.

If no verified fork is found, ask whether the user has already created one. If
yes, ask for its URL when it cannot be discovered and verify the parent. If no,
ask whether the user authorizes creating a fork. After the user says yes, open
`https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library/fork` in the user's
browser and ask the user to choose the owner/name and click **Create fork**.
Do not click the creation button for the user. Pause until the user confirms
that GitHub finished creating the fork, then discover and verify its exact URL.
If the user declines, stop before implementation and report that a fork is
required for the upstream contribution workflow.

After verification, reuse a suitable existing local clone or clone the user's
fork. Configure remotes so:

- `origin` is the user's verified fork;
- `upstream` is `https://github.com/superdurable/dex-connectors-library`.

Fetch the latest `upstream/main`, read its `AGENTS.md`, preserve unrelated user
files, and create an isolated `codex/` branch or managed worktree from
`upstream/main`. Push only to the user's fork. Open the PR from that fork branch
to the official repository's `main`. Never replace, delete, or repoint an
in-use local clone without confirming it is safe.

## Repository boundaries

- Keep the shared Go SDK in `sdkgo`.
- Keep every connector in its own Go module.
- Group a company's connectors below `connectors/<company>/...`.
- Make the first directory below `connectors/` equal `metadata.company`'s
  normalized company identity and provide its `logo.svg`.
- Give every connector its own `go.mod`, README, `connector.yaml`, generated Go
  file, provider tests, and any UI package.
- Register a connector directory in the sorted root `connectors.yaml` only when
  that directory is added, moved, or removed. A version-only change does not
  alter the registry.

## Manifest-first implementation

Treat `connector.yaml` as the release and code-generation source of truth for:

- company metadata and `metadata.version`;
- configuration and generated `Config`;
- auth fields and generated `Credentials`;
- Trigger, Query, Mutation, branch, retry, and execution definitions;
- operation-specific Step factories and defaults;
- Studio setup, commands, UI units, ports, and generated constants.

Run `connectorctl generate` after the manifest changes. Review generated code;
do not hand-edit it. Run the corresponding `--check` target before handoff.

## Versions and release order

`metadata.version` is the connector release source of truth. Leaving it
unchanged deliberately defers a release. A declared version must equal the
latest tag or the next patch, minor, or major version; first releases use
`v0.1.0`.

SDK tags use `sdkgo/vX.Y.Z`. Connector tags use the module directory, for
example `connectors/slack/vX.Y.Z`. Pin only an exact published SDK tag in a
connector `go.mod`.

When discovery exposes an SDK contract gap:

1. develop SDK and connector together with `go.work` or a temporary local
   `replace`;
2. run the full connector verification against that local SDK;
3. remove the replacement;
4. open, merge, and release the SDK PR;
5. open a later connector PR pinned to the exact new SDK release.

Never publish a branch, pseudo-version, commit SHA, or replacement. Before
release, test every module with `GOWORK=off`. Connector releases run after merge
to `main`; manual release runs only recover incomplete releases and catalog
deployment.

A v0 breaking release cannot be a patch. A v1+ breaking release requires a
major-version module-path migration before release. Put the exact lowercase
token `(breaking)` in the PR title or body and final commit subject for every
public breaking change.

## PR shape

Prefer one released module per PR. Use repository commit scopes:

- `sdkgo: ...`
- `connector(<name>): ...`
- `connector(<company>/<name>): ...`
- `tooling: ...`
- `docs: ...`

The PR explains the provider public API or official SDK used, capability and
failure semantics, version change, example, tests, live-test status, security
boundary, and any follow-up release dependency. Do not merge the PR on the
user's behalf unless explicitly authorized.

## Fixed immutable reference snapshot

The public examples used by this skill are validated against the immutable
`connectors/slack/v0.9.0` repository snapshot. At that snapshot the exact
published component versions are:

- Connector SDK `sdkgo/v0.8.0`;
- Slack `connectors/slack/v0.9.0`;
- Gmail `connectors/google/gmail/v0.10.0`;
- Google Sheets `connectors/google/spreadsheet/v0.7.0`.

These are reference baselines, not permission to downgrade a repository. For
new work, inspect current `origin/main` and the latest published component tag.
If a required tag is absent or its release failed, stop and report the release
blocker; never substitute a branch, pseudo-version, or commit SHA in public
guidance.
