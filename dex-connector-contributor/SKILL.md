description: Create or modify official Superdurable Dex connectors, operations, Triggers, and configuration UI units in superdurable/dex-connectors-library. Use for connector-library contribution work that must start from documented provider APIs or official SDKs, add a runnable connector-local example, run full validation, and open a review pull request. Do not use merely to consume an already released connector in an application.

# Dex Connector Contributor

Contribute one reviewable connector capability to the official
`superdurable/dex-connectors-library`. Preserve Dex durability, provider
correctness, credential isolation, generated contracts, and release order.

## Required foundations

Before changing connector behavior:

1. Read the sibling [Dex SDK skill](../dex-sdk/SKILL.md) completely.
2. Follow its progressive-disclosure routing, loading only the required Core
   references and the [Go handbook](../dex-sdk/references/go/go.md).
3. Read the shared [Dex Web v2 reference](../dex-app-builder/references/dex-web-v2.md)
   for Start Flow, Connections, configuration, and Studio behavior.
4. Read [repository workflow](references/repository-workflow.md).
5. Load only the task references that apply:
   [operations](references/operations.md), [Triggers](references/triggers.md),
   [UI units](references/ui-units.md), and
   [examples, testing, and PR](references/examples-testing-pr.md).

Dex SDK owns Flow, Step, retry, Attribute, Stream, RPC, and versioning
semantics. Do not restate or weaken them. The connector-library rules in this
skill are additional constraints.

## Scope gate

Use this skill only for the official connector library. If the task only uses a
published connector in an application, route to `$dex-sdk` or
`$dex-app-builder`. If a missing or defective connector blocks an application,
separate the connector contribution into this workflow; keep any temporary
application `go.work` or `replace` uncommitted until an exact connector release
exists.

Use only a provider's documented public API or official SDK. Do not scrape a
private endpoint, copy browser credentials, reverse-engineer an internal
protocol, or claim support that the provider does not publish.

## Contribution sequence

Use this order:

1. Fetch the latest `origin/main`, inspect repository instructions, and create
   an isolated `codex/` branch without disturbing unrelated files.
2. Identify the provider capability, public contract, auth scopes, rate limits,
   idempotency support, pagination, event acknowledgement, and failure modes.
3. Update `connector.yaml`, then run code generation before provider code.
4. Implement the provider adapter and provider-facing tests.
5. Add Trigger and UI-unit behavior when the capability needs them.
6. Add or extend a connector-local runnable example.
7. Run the complete verification matrix and inspect generated/catalog drift.
8. Commit one clean module-scoped change, push it, open a ready-for-review PR,
   and monitor required CI until it passes.

Do not skip the manifest-first step. Generated `Config`, `Credentials`,
definitions, branch constants, operation-specific factories, UI constants, and
defaults must remain derived from `connector.yaml`.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Make provider calls only from a Connector Step `Execute`. RPCs route or
  mutate Dex state; they do not call providers.
- Require only the happy-path branch by default. Mark every other operation
  branch `optional: true`; make one required only when the application must
  choose a distinct continuation and explain why.
- Default Execute durability to `async`. Use `sync` only when the provider call
  is very likely to exceed seven seconds, not merely because its timeout is
  high.
- Keep credentials and raw secrets out of Flow input, Attributes, Results,
  receipts, Streams, logs, generated values, fixtures, and release artifacts.
- Register every application-provided Attribute and Stream in the consuming
  Flow persistence schema.
- Pin an exact published `sdkgo` version in each connector module. Never commit
  a branch, pseudo-version, SHA, or local `replace`.
- If the connector exposes an SDK contract gap, verify the SDK and connector
  together locally, then publish the SDK PR and tag before opening the connector
  PR that consumes it.
- Release one connector module per PR unless a repository-wide mechanical
  change genuinely requires more.

## Example gate

A new connector or major capability normally includes a runnable example inside
that connector. Extend a suitable existing example instead of duplicating it.

- With a Trigger, demonstrate real provider event delivery to a typed Flow
  start and/or typed RPC target, including duplicate delivery and restart
  recovery.
- Without a Trigger, generate valid FDG 2.0 and run the example through Dex Web
  v2 **Start Flow**.

The example is part of acceptance, not illustrative pseudocode.

## Handoff gate

Do not call the contribution complete until:

- module-isolated race tests and vet pass with `GOWORK=off`;
- UI tests and production builds pass when UI exists;
- codegen, registry, catalog, real Dex integration, FDG 2.0, current Dex
  compatibility, and repository `make check` pass;
- safe live provider tests pass when credentials exist, or the PR names the
  exact unverified live behavior;
- the worktree contains one clean commit and no unrelated changes;
- the ready-for-review PR records test evidence and required CI is green.

Use the repository's `$opr` workflow for publication and CI monitoring.
